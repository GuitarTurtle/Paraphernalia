This is a collection of scripts I like to use as a starting point when I sit down to make a game. 
I don't claim to understand the legality of putting all of these files in one place and giving them 
a common namespace, but since Editor extensions aren't compiled with your game's binary issues with 
copyleft software may not affect your project. Not all files share the same license. Check the 
comments at the top of those files to know. Furthermore, it's likely that many of the authors of
the files posted on wiki.unity3d.com were not aware that content is automatically licensed under
Creative Commons Attribution Share Alike. The author of MaxRectsBinPack, for example, clearly 
states that the work is public domain and you can "do whatever you want with it."
